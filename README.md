# python-autograding-application
Full-stack program built using the LAMP Stack along with front-end web development languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a Python Autograding website where you must allow students to take programming questions in the application and provide the instructor with autograded results to be published. 

NOTE: Since the completion of this project, NJIT has deactivated Linux Apache Servers hosting the backend and frontend of the software.
